The game field is a matrix of size 109×109
, with a cell at the intersection of the a
-th row and the b
-th column denoted as (a,b
).

There are n
 monsters on the game field, with the i
-th monster located in the cell (xi,yi
), while the other cells are empty. No more than one monster can occupy a single cell.

You can move one monster to any cell on the field that is not occupied by another monster at most once .

After that, you must select one rectangle on the field; all monsters within the selected rectangle will be destroyed. You must pay 1
 coin for each cell in the selected rectangle.

Your task is to find the minimum number of coins required to destroy all the monsters.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of monsters on the field.

The following n
 lines contain two integers xi
 and yi
 (1≤xi,yi≤109
) — the coordinates of the cell with the i
-th monster. All pairs (xi,yi
) are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum cost to destroy all n
 monsters.
